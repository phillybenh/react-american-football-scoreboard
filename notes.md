**React Components and Component State**

* *React JS*
    * Is a user interface component library
    * [https://reactjs.org/](https://reactjs.org/)
    * [https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
    * *NOT* a framework
    * "It is really important to understand that React is just a single paradigm, or one of many ways to write large applications."
    * React uses a `virtual DOM` to interact with the DOM adn tell the DOM what elements and state data to render
    * Uses the JSX language - uses HTML like  format and allows inline JS

* Components must be capitalized and return something
* Two pillars of React's design philosophy:
    * *the separation of concerns*
        * each piece of code should do one and only one thing
    * *declarative programing*
        * instead of telling computer how we want something done (step by step), tell computer *what* we want it to do
